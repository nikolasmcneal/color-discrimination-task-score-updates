# color-discrimination-task_score-updates

## About

A Javascript-based implementation of a 2AFC color discrimination task.

To run, download the repository and open **index.html** in a web browser.

This codebase is built off the [original repository](https://github.com/nikolasmcneal/color-discrimination-task), with two significant modifications:

1. Every n trials during the experiment block, the current score is shown to the user.
2. "fixedfirst" -- the variable which determines whether the fixed reward experiment block or value-based experiment block goes first -- is now manually set as a parameter.
